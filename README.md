# To-do-list

> This is my first project using webpack in the Microverse. The objective was to build a to-do-list by sticking with some design criteria, some ES6 modules and syntax. For that I created to-do-list repo and cloned into my local machine. For best practices I have implemented Linter,Github Flow and professional documentation as much as I can.
